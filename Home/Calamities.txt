====== Calamities ======
Created Sunday 21 February 2021

Should be linked to some kind of theme. Needs a **fine** balance between ¨oh god wtf we´re never gonna fix this¨ and the players being able to figure it out in like... 2 eras
	is this balance even possible?

Always big enough to end all life/civilisation. Not big enough to destroy the world?
	There needs to be an opportunity for learning from previous Eras. If you can´t: whatś the point.
