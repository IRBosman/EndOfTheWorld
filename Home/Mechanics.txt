Created Sunday 21 February 2021

Principles:
1: Should be applicable widely.
	If you´re running over a broad set of modes of play and kinds of Eras, you can just be stuck with rules about ¨lol, this is how you swing a sword¨. Having rules that do not apply to an Era sounds weird
2: Should be simple
	Basically same as above.
